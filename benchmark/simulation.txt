Will compute ground state energy of test state function. Will print expected energy, expected kinetic energy, expected potential energy, mean distance between particles (printed in that order)


Syntax is mpirun -n <num threads> ./mons <num particles> <alpha> <beta> <omega> <dt>

Example:

~ $ /usr/bin/mpirun -n 4 ../code/simulation/mons 2 1 0.4 1 0.001
