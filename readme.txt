Hello world

The benchmark directory has all the info you need. The code dir contains three folders. The "mons" program in code/sumulation will simulate for a given set of variational params. The "mons" program in code/steepest dir will do steepest decent given variational params. The code dir also has a blocking script, which will fetch data from the resources dir.
